<p>
  I am second year Computer Science and Mathematics student at UNSW. 
  Unforunately I am still 18 and play <a>League of Legends</a>. 
  Also a certified <a>DevSoc enjoyer</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I peaked in <a>Comp1511</a> tbh, all my grades have been going down after T1.
  It's been pretty hard to learn how to make a website too in one night but
  that's why they invented <a>ChatGPT</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this website is good enough. Can I still join the <a>meros</a> if I'm a trainee? Also if <bea>Omar</bea> makes it as a trainee lead please put us together.
</p>
