  I am third year student at UNSW and want to learn how to make websites!! 
  Unforunately I don't study comp sci (data science) and thus do not play <a>League of Legends</a>. 
  Also a certified <a>DevSoc enjoyer</a> (i love tp i love tp).
</p>
<p>
  It's been pretty hard to learn how to make a website too in one night but
  that's why they invented <a>ChatGPT</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I hope this website is good enough. Can I still join the <a>meros</a> if I'm a trainee?
